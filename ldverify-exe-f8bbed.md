As a legitimate component of MAME, ldverify.exe is not a virus or malware, and it is considered safe to use, provided that it is downloaded from trusted sources, such as the official MAME website. However, users may encounter errors related to ldverify.exe if the file is corrupted, missing, or if there are compatibility issues with their operating system. It's important for users to ensure that they have the correct version, in this case, version 0.211b, to minimize potential issues and maintain optimal performance while using the MAME emulator.
